                With our pay-for-results model, you only pay when we deliver qualified appointments. 
                There are no upfront fees or retainers - you simply pay for the actual meetings that 
                we set up with potential clients who match your ideal customer profile.

                Most clients start seeing qualified appointments within 2-3 weeks of starting our 
                program. After the initial ramp-up period, we typically deliver 3-5 high-quality 
                appointments per week depending on your target market and criteria.
